              <h3>Duck Dodgers vs Marvin the Martian</h3>
              <p>Project for my Data Structures and Objects class where there are two characters named Duck Dodgers and Marvin the Martian that are trying to reach the Illudium Phosdex. In this game, there is a hexagonal map where the user defines the coordinates of Duck, Marvin, the Illudium Phosdex, and various spots where there is lava in their way. An algorithm is used to find the shortest paths while avoiding the lava and if Duck does not win, he summons Gandalf which will search for a spot in Marvin's way to block him and guarantee Duck's victory if it is possible. The purpose of this project was primarily to create a program that uses queues and linear lists. </p>

              <h3>Hexmap Maze</h3>
              <p>Final project for Data Structure and Objects that utilized stacks, disjoint sets, and a sampler. This program created a random maze of many hexagons and used a path-finding algorithm to find a way from one corner of the maze to the other. It then printed a drawing of the maze along with lines that show each path that would result in a dead-end and the final path to the end. The user could make the maze any size they wished which would create many different outcomes depending on how the maze was generated. </p>
